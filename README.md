[TiddlyWiki5] server (portable) with many plugins included

## TiddlyWiki

[TiddlyWiki5] is a [WikiText] [markdown] oriented non-linear [Wiki] server, with a catch : it is written in [JavaScript] and is self-embedded into one big (around 3+ MB) [HTML] file, hence allows to carry around the server and its data in one portable file.

To get the base [HTML] file, simply follow this link and click on the green "Download" button :

* https://tiddlywiki.com/#GettingStarted

You now have an up-to-date [TiddlyWiki5] locally, just open the [HTML] file to convince yourself.

To save your personal copy of [TiddlyWiki5], simply overwrite the [HTML] file or save into a new file.

Some browsers' extension even provide you with an autosave feature so it become almost transparent for the user and it's like editing a distant [Wiki] even though everything is stored locally :

### Version

There are two main branches of **TiddlyWiki** : [Classic] and `5`

Version `5` is a complete rewrite of the [Classic] version that continued to evolve separately. Both aren't compatible.

This repository focuses on version `5` and onward.

The project page for the [Classic] version is here :

* https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/TiddlyWikiClassic

### WikiText

The [WikiText] syntax is a bit complex and not as friendly like [GitHub markdown], yet it is syntax originated and used by [WikiPedia].

### Tutorial

[TiddlyWiki5] pages/notes are called [Tiddlers] (go figure) and can contain [WikiText], code (plugins) or both. There are visible [Tiddlers] and hidden/system ones (server code, plugins, configuration data, etc). In general only the visible [Tiddlers] are available through the interface, the hidden/system ones can be only edited/deleted through setting/configuration pages.

There are many tutorials to learn how to use [TiddlyWiki5] :

* https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzZCajspPU_UjFn0uy-J9URz0LP4zhxRK

The layout and theme may be modified, many things are configurable through the "gear" icon. Explore the tabs and settings pages to make yourself familiar with a typical [TiddlyWiki5] system.

### Plugins

The server can be extended with plugins ([officials] and [community] created, or [other]). Of course the size of the [HTML] file grows with each addition, data or plugin, making it a bit less "portable" (ie. mails).

Some plugins also have their own tutorials :

#### Installation

To install a plugin, in general you just have to *Drag'n Drop* the plugin "box" from one offline or online [TiddlyWiki5] containing it to your one to have the plugin copied into it. Other installation method requires messing with hidden/system [Tiddlers] (don't bother, it can go pretty technical).

* Plugin name: plugin description
* $:/plugins/path
* ve.rs.ion

#### Development

You may want to create/modify plugins, this [Tiddlers] provides you with technical details :

* https://tiddlywiki.com/dev/

## Bob

[Bob] is a self-contained [Node.js] server into one (45+ MB) portable [Windows] application that can handle multiple users as well. Instead to save everything into one bigger and bigger [HTML] file, the [Tiddlers] are saved into an `IndexWiki/` subfolder, plugins into `Plugins/`, and so on.

While you loose the "portability" of one big [HTML] file, you gain the ability to serve your [Tiddlers] to multiple users, either locally or online (using the right IP/firewall settings). You can also access the [Tiddlers] files (visible, but also hidden/system ones) individually and even perform some operation on them if needed (ie. convert them to LaTeX).

[Bob]: https://github.com/OokTech/TW5-Bob
[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/en
[Windows]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows

### Version

[Bob] is providing a specific [TiddlyWiki5] version that cannot be updated without changing the server binary. It's a drawback because it can lag a few versions behind. New server binaries can be found here :

* https://github.com/OokTech/TW5-BobEXE/releases (beware of the date and version number)

### Running

Since [Bob] is a local server, you may edit the `IndexWiki/settings/settings.json` file to change the settings to suit your needs :

* `ws-server/port` : default is **9080**
* `ws-server/host` : default is **0.0.0.0** aka **localhost**

Then launch `BobWin.bat`, **NOT** the `.exe` file, for the [Node.js] server to be run and your default browser be opened on the right IP address.

You **may** have to allow your firewall to provide access to the port/traffic. If your browser timed out, reload the page once you granted [Bob] firewall access.

### Saving

Unlike a the one big [HTML] file that needs a browser extension to save datas/plugins on itself without manual interaction, [Bob] handle the saving on the host filesystem automatically, hence the user don't have to worry about this. As soon as a [Tiddlers] is modified or a plugin added, it is immediately saved on the host.

Regular archiving of the [TiddlyWiki5] files can then be done either by save the whole [Bob] folder (simple and secure) or just the subfolders (`IndexWiki/` and `Plugins/` most notably). A [Git] repository can also serve as a mean to have [Tiddlers] versioning. Hence the user can fork this repository with a new/dedicated name for this very purpose.

[Git]: https://git-scm.com/

### Stopping

Just close the [Bob] window, the server is killed, the current opened [TiddlyWiki5] page will warn about the connection loss. Just restart [Bob] to regain connection. Beware of any data loss though.
